I am currently employed as an algorithm engineer at Tencent PCG, specializing in the domain of Text Matching. I obtained my MA.Sc. degree in software engineering from Northeastern University in 2020, and prior to that, I completed my B.S. degree in computer science at Beijing University of Technology in 2016. My research pursuits primarily revolve around the fields of Data Mining (DM) and Information Retrieval (IR). I have had the privilege of publishing numerous papers in esteemed conferences that focus on information retrieval and data mining, such as KDD, TKDE, CIKM, and ets. Additionally, I actively contribute as a reviewer for various conferences, including EMNLP, among others.
